## 📃 Text Description

### Inspiration

Golf clubs use legacy booking systems like PC Caddy where popular tee times open exactly 6 days in advance – often at 9 PM. Miss that window by minutes, and the slots are gone. We built an AI agent that solves this: it watches the clock, navigates the booking portal the moment it opens, and secures your tee time. Automatically. Every week.

### What it does

The **GolfStatus Browser Agent** is a fully autonomous UI Navigator that:

- **Observes** the browser through screenshots (no DOM access, no APIs)
- **Understands** each page using **Gemini 2.5 Flash** multimodal vision
- **Acts** by clicking, typing, and scrolling at precise screen coordinates
- **Completes** complex 31-step workflows across real booking portals
- **Runs on schedule** – weekly at a specific day and time, fully unattended

The agent navigates login forms, calendars, time pickers, player registration, and booking confirmation – all through visual understanding alone.

### How we built it

**Architecture:** Flutter mobile app → Cloud Functions (Go) → Cloud Run (Playwright + Gemini Vision)

- **Browser Agent (Cloud Run):** A headless Chromium browser controlled by Playwright, guided by Gemini Vision. Each step follows a Screenshot → Gemini → Action → Screenshot loop. Gemini receives the screenshot and a description of what to find, returns (x, y) coordinates, and the agent clicks.

- **Skill DSL:** Admins define agent behavior as a sequence of steps in a simple JSON-based DSL. Actions include `click`, `find_click` (visual search), `input`, `screenshot`, `wait`, `abort_if`, and more. The `find_click` action is key – it tells Gemini to visually locate the best matching UI element, perfect for finding the first available slot in a calendar grid.

- **Orchestration (Cloud Functions, Go):** Manages agent lifecycle, resolves input placeholders, enforces sandbox mode, and writes real-time step logs to Firestore.

- **Sandbox Mode:** Every run can be executed in sandbox mode – the agent navigates and screenshots everything but does NOT click submit buttons. Safe for testing and demos.

- **Scheduling:** Users switch from manual to scheduled execution. Pick a weekday and time, and the agent runs via Cloud Scheduler. Book every Saturday tee time at exactly 9 PM on Tuesday – automatically.

### Technologies Used

| Component | Technology | Google Cloud Service |
|---|---|---|
| Vision AI | Gemini 2.5 Flash (multimodal) | Vertex AI / GenAI SDK |
| Browser | Playwright (headless Chromium) | **Cloud Run** |
| Orchestration | Go Cloud Functions (2nd Gen) | **Cloud Functions** |
| Data Store | Firestore real-time | **Firestore** |
| Mobile App | Flutter (Dart) | **Firebase** |
| Scheduling | Cron triggers | **Cloud Scheduler** |
| Video Gen | Veo 3.1 (intro/outro) | **Vertex AI** |
| TTS | Neural2 voice | **Cloud Text-to-Speech** |

**Google Cloud Services used:** Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, Firestore, Cloud Scheduler, Vertex AI (Gemini + Veo), Cloud Text-to-Speech, Firebase Auth, Cloud Storage

### Challenges and Learnings

1. **Vision-only navigation is hard.** Early versions struggled with dropdowns and overlapping elements. We learned that Gemini works best with clean screenshots and precise prompts that describe what to look for ("the green button labeled Submit"), not abstract concepts.

2. **Timing matters.** A booking agent needs to act at the exact right moment. We integrated Cloud Scheduler to trigger runs precisely when reservation windows open – making this a truly autonomous system.

3. **Sandbox mode was essential.** During development, the agent accidentally booked real tee times. Sandbox mode (Gemini still plans every action, but form submissions are skipped) became crucial for safe iteration.

4. **The human touch.** Built by a 70-year-old developer with 50+ years of experience – from IBM mainframes to modern cloud-native architecture. This project proves that passion for building never gets old.

### What's next

- **Multi-portal support:** Expand beyond PC Caddy to other booking systems
- **Voice control:** "Hey GolfStatus, book me a tee time for Saturday" via Gemini Live API
- **Intelligent slot selection:** Let Gemini choose the optimal time based on weather forecasts and player availability
